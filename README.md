Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

The build folder will be created in the project root.
This folder contains static project files that can be hosted.

Using nginx is recommended.
[Configure nginx for nodejs backend and React frontend app](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/configure-nginx-for-nodejs-backend-and-react-frontend-app)
In the nginx configuration, you need to configure proxying API requests to port 3003.
